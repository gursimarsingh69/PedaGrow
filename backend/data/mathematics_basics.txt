Mathematics Basics - Core Concepts

ALGEBRA:
Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols and letters to represent numbers and quantities in formulas and equations. Key concepts include:
- Variables: Letters like x, y, z that represent unknown values
- Equations: Mathematical statements showing equality (e.g., 2x + 3 = 11)
- Solving equations: Finding the value of variables that make the equation true
- Linear equations: Equations where the highest power of the variable is 1
- Quadratic equations: Equations where the highest power is 2 (ax² + bx + c = 0)

GEOMETRY:
Geometry is the study of shapes, sizes, positions, and properties of space. Important topics:
- Points, lines, and planes: Basic building blocks of geometry
- Angles: Formed when two rays share a common endpoint
- Triangles: Three-sided polygons with various types (equilateral, isosceles, scalene)
- Circles: All points equidistant from a center point
- Area and perimeter: Measurements of two-dimensional shapes
- Volume: Measurement of three-dimensional space

CALCULUS:
Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change. Main branches:
- Differential calculus: Studies rates of change and slopes
- Integral calculus: Studies accumulation of quantities
- Limits: The value a function approaches as input approaches a value
- Derivatives: Measure instantaneous rate of change
- Integrals: Measure accumulation over an interval

PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES:
1. Understand the problem: Read carefully and identify what's being asked
2. Plan your approach: Decide which formulas or methods to use
3. Execute: Work through the problem step by step
4. Check your answer: Verify that your solution makes sense
