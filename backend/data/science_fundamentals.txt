Science Fundamentals - Core Concepts

PHYSICS:
Physics is the study of matter, energy, and their interactions. Key topics:
- Motion: Described by position, velocity, and acceleration
- Forces: Push or pull that can change an object's motion (Newton's Laws)
- Energy: Capacity to do work (kinetic, potential, thermal)
- Waves: Transfer of energy without transferring matter
- Electricity: Flow of electric charge
- Magnetism: Force exerted by magnets and moving charges
- Light: Electromagnetic radiation visible to the human eye

CHEMISTRY:
Chemistry studies the composition, structure, and properties of matter. Important concepts:
- Atoms: Basic building blocks of matter (protons, neutrons, electrons)
- Elements: Pure substances made of one type of atom
- Compounds: Substances formed when two or more elements combine
- Chemical reactions: Processes where substances transform into new substances
- Periodic table: Organization of elements by atomic number and properties
- Acids and bases: Substances with different pH levels
- Chemical bonds: Forces holding atoms together (ionic, covalent)

BIOLOGY:
Biology is the study of living organisms and their processes. Core areas:
- Cells: Basic unit of life (prokaryotic and eukaryotic)
- Genetics: Study of heredity and variation (DNA, genes, chromosomes)
- Evolution: Process of change in species over time
- Ecosystems: Communities of organisms and their environments
- Photosynthesis: Process by which plants convert light energy to chemical energy
- Respiration: Process of breaking down food to release energy
- Classification: Organizing living things into groups (kingdom, phylum, class, etc.)

SCIENTIFIC METHOD:
1. Observation: Notice something interesting
2. Question: Ask why or how
3. Hypothesis: Make an educated guess
4. Experiment: Test the hypothesis
5. Analysis: Examine the results
6. Conclusion: Determine if hypothesis was correct
